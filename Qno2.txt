Q2.Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model
	1.justify-content:- The justify-content property in flexbox is used to control the alignment of flex items along the main axis 
	   of the flex container.it determines how the extra space or insufficient space along the main axis is distributed.There are several 
	  values for justify-content,including flex-start,flex-end,center,space-between,space-evenly and space-around.

	2.align-items:-The align-items property controls the alignment of the flex items along the cross axis of the flex container.it specifies
	  how items are positioned within their container along the axis.it accepts values such as flex-start,flex-end,center,baseline and stretch.

	3.gap:- The gap property is used to define the space between flex items in both directions, both along the main axis and the cross axis.it's 
	  often applied to the flex container itself.it simplifies spacing and creates consistent gaps between items without needing to apply margins
	  to individual items.

	4.flex-direction:- The Flex direction property determines the direction in which flex items are placed within the flex-container.it defines the 
	  main axis and, consequently, the layout flow. it can have values such as row,row-reverse,column,or column-reverse.

	5.flex-wrap:The flex-wrap property controls wheather flex items are allowed to wrap onto multiple lines within the flex container when they
	  don't fit along the main axis.it accepts values like nowrap,wrap,and wrap-reverse.
