01. Describe the main differeces between the CSS Fexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other?
Ans:The main difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox is the dimensionality of the layouts they create:
	Flexbox :-Designed for one-dimensional layouts, either rows or columns. Flexbox is better for simpler 
		    layouts and automatically adjusts element positioning and margins relative to one another.
		     Flexbox uses a parent element called a Flex Container and child elements called Flex Items. 
		     The Flex Container can adjust item dimensions to ensure balanced representation.
		      Flexbox is ideal for handling elements along a single axis

	CSS Grid :-Designed for two-dimensional layouts, using both rows and columns. CSS Grid is better for 
		     complex layouts with more control over rows and columns, but requires manual definition of 
		     each element's size and positioning. 
		     CSS Grid supports both explicit and implicit content placement.
		     CSS Grid is better for creating more complex and organized layouts.

	Choosing between Flexbox and css Grid depends in your specific layout requirements.
	
	You might choose Flexbox when you need to arrange items along a single axis, for example, when Creating navigation bars,
	header/footer layouts , or aligning elements within a container.Flexbox is great for responsive designs where items can 
	vary in size.

	You might choose CSS Grid when you need to create more complex, two-dimensional layouts with rows, columns, it;s particularly
	useful when you have grid-like structure, such as galleries,forms with multiple  fields, or any design that requires precise control 
	over both rows and columns.
